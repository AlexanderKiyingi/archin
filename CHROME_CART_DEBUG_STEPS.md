# Chrome Cart Display Issue - Debug Steps

## Current Issue
Items not showing up in the cart page on Chrome (but work on Firefox).

## Recent Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Added cache-busting to `loadCart()` function
2. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging
3. ✅ Fixed null reference errors
4. ✅ Fixed image path handling

## Debug Steps to Follow

### Step 1: Open Cart Page in Chrome
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to: `http://localhost/archin/cart.php`
3. Open Developer Tools (F12)
4. Go to Console tab

### Step 2: Check Console Logs
You should see these logs in order:
```
🛒 Cart loaded: {success: true, data: {...}}
📦 Cart items: [...]
🎨 Rendering cart with X items
📦 Rendering X cart items
```

### Step 3: What to Report

**If you see "📭 Cart is empty":**
- The session is not persisting
- Need to check session cookie settings

**If you see "❌ cartItems element not found":**
- DOM element missing from HTML
- Need to check HTML structure

**If you see cart items but nothing displays:**
- Issue with template rendering
- Check for JavaScript syntax errors

**If you see no logs at all:**
- JavaScript not executing
- Check for syntax errors earlier in the code

### Step 4: Check Network Tab
1. In Chrome DevTools, go to Network tab
2. Refresh the cart page
3. Look for `cart-ajax.php` request
4. Click on it
5. Check the Response tab
6. **Tell me what you see**

### Step 5: Check Application Tab
1. In Chrome DevTools, go to Application tab
2. Under Storage > Cookies
3. Look for `PHPSESSID` cookie
4. **Check if it exists and has a value**

## Common Chrome-Specific Issues

### Issue 1: Session Cookie Not Set
**Solution:** Already applied - added SameSite: Lax

### Issue 2: Cache Preventing Updates
**Solution:** Already applied - added cache-busting

### Issue 3: DOM Not Ready
**Solution:** Code wrapped in DOMContentLoaded

### Issue 4: Async Timing Issue
**Possible:** loadCart is async, might not complete before render

## What to Tell Me

Please copy and paste:

1. **All console logs** from cart page
2. **cart-ajax.php response** from Network tab
3. **PHPSESSID cookie value** (just confirm it exists, don't share the actual value)
4. **Any error messages** in red in console

This will help me identify the exact issue!
