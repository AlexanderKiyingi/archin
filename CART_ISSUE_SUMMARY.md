- `CART_DEBUG_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step debugging guide

## Most Likely Issues

### Issue #1: No Products in Database (MOST COMMON)
**Symptom:** Cart-ajax returns "Product not found"
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM shop_products WHERE is_active = 1;
```
**Fix:** Add products via the CMS at `/cms/index.php` â†’ Shop Products

### Issue #2: Wrong Database Name
**Symptom:** Database connection error or products not loading
**Current database name:** `u680675202_flipavenue_cms` (Hostinger format)
**Check:** Make sure this database exists locally or update `cms/db_connect.php` with local database name

### Issue #3: JavaScript Not Loading
**Symptom:** Button click does nothing, no console logs
**Check:** 
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Check if jQuery is loaded: Type `jQuery` in console, should not be "undefined"

### Issue #4: Session Not Working
**Symptom:** Cart doesn't persist between pages
**Check:** Open `debug-cart.php` to see session status

### Issue #5: Button Event Listener Not Attached
**Symptom:** Clicking button does nothing
**Check:** 
- Inspect the button element
- Verify it has class `add-to-cart-btn`
- Verify it has `data-product` attribute

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

### 1. Check Console (Browser F12)
When you click "Add to Cart", you should see:
```
ðŸ›’ Adding to cart: {id: 1, name: "...", price: ...}
ðŸ“¡ Response status: 200
ðŸ“¦ Cart response: {success: true, message: "...", data: {...}}
```

### 2. Check Network Tab (Browser F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Click "Add to Cart"
- Look for `cart-ajax.php` request
- Check the Response (should be valid JSON)
- Check the Preview (should show success: true or error message)

### 3. Check PHP Error Log
Location: `C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log` or similar
Look for lines containing: "Cart AJAX -"

## Next Steps for User

**Please run this test and report back:**

1. Open: `http://localhost/archin/test-cart-simple.html`
2. Click "Add Product ID 1 to Cart"
3. Tell me what you see - does it say "Success" or "Error"?
4. If error, what's the error message?

**Also check:**

5. Open: `http://localhost/archin/shop.php`
6. Open browser console (F12)
7. Click any "Add to Cart" button
8. Copy and paste ALL the console output here

## Potential Quick Fixes

### If database name is wrong:
Edit `cms/db_connect.php` line 14:
```php
// Change this:
define('DB_NAME', 'u680675202_flipavenue_cms');

// To this (for local XAMPP):
define('DB_NAME', 'flipavenue_cms');
```

### If no products in database:
Import the database: `cms/database.sql` or add products via CMS

### If JavaScript error:
Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete) and refresh (Ctrl + F5)
